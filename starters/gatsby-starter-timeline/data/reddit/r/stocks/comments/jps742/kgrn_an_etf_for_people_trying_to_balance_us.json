  "selftext": "[KGRN is Kraneshares' China green energy ETF](https://kraneshares.com/kgrn/). \n\nIt's top stock holding is NIO at 13%. It complements an American green energy ETF like QCLN or ICLN, which tend to contain TSLA as a top holding and then more American solar companies and renewable companies. \n\nIt's probably a good idea to either look at its holdings for ideas for individual stocks to study, or to simply just buy and ride its gains if you're not interested in individual stock picking.  Its top non-stock holding right now is \"Cash\", which means it's in a position to invest and increase returns that have already been really good lately. \n\nDownsides: Chinese ETFs can be more volatile than US markets and even great stocks can sag for stretches for no apparent reason, in-between big leaps up that will catch you by surprise. But this is true of individual Chinese growth stocks like NIO, as well. \n\nUpsides: A lot of the companies listed aren't able to be directly purchased by Westerners as they aren't listed on US or Euro exchanges. That means that it's harder for them to tank quickly due to crazy stuff happening in our stock markets. So they have less exposure to downside mini-crashes over the past year. \n\nFor all of the above reasons, it can significantly outperform US stocks in a run-up of solar/renewable/EV stocks as we saw this week. [Here is a chart of KGRN vs QCLN, ICLN and TAN](https://imgur.com/CEqom7o) (top-performing green ETFs for US stocks). \n\nIf you want more exposure to renewables and Chinese EVs without having to individually stock pick, to balance out the US renewable and EV stocks, I would recommend checking out KGRN.",
