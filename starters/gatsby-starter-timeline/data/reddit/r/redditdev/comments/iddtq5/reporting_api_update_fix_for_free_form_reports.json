  "selftext": "Hey 3rd party devs,\n\nWe're making some changes to how reporting works in our API and wanted to let you know. Currently if a community has chosen to not allow free form reports from users, our API did not enforce that setting. We’re here to give you a heads up that will be changing on Monday September 21st, 2020. See below for all the details.\n\n**Previously:**\n\n* We have a community setting, `free_form_reports`, that mods can set to disallow the ability to send custom reports for subreddits.\n* However, that setting has previously not restricted third party clients from sending custom reports.\n* As a result, mods have faced some report harassment or just confusion when reports come through that don't match their expected reasons.\n\n**Starting September 21st:**\n\n* We'll be migrating toward strict validation for report reasons. We will begin to return an error if a custom report is sent when a subreddit has not allowed free form reports.\n* This means that if `free_form_reports` is set to `false` in a subreddits settings, all report reasons must either match a site wide rule or a subreddit rule violation reason, or they'll receive an error with a matching error response, `FREE_FORM_REPORTS_NOT_ALLOWED`.\n\n**What you can do now:**\n\n* **You can test this behavior now** by adding `strict_freeform_reports=1` to your POST to report, which will return an error if a custom report is sent when it’s not allowed.\n* If you have a UI for reporting, we recommend you begin checking if free form reports are enabled, or the user is a mod of the subreddit, before displaying \"other\" style report fields. You can check if a subreddit has free form reports enabled by their info.json. For example, /r/changelogs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/about.json](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/about.json) has `free_form_reports` set to `true`.\n* If needed, you can get the rules a subreddit has set for itself in /about/rules in the API.\n\n[This change is also represented in our API docs here](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#POST_api_report).\n\nLet us know in the comments if you have any questions.\n\nEDIT: Updated to reflect that error responses returned are not 400 level responses, but just general reddit errors with 200 level responses. Thanks u/talklittle!",
